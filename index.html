          <p>I graduated college with a degree in Technical Theatre and I’ve been working in the live entertainment industry ever since, mostly on large circus-themed productions in Las Vegas. In this profession, the main focus is on entertaining the audience. My coworkers and I all contribute to the common goal of making the audience happy. I would love to work with other software developers with the same “customer-first” mentality.</p>
          <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy trying all kinds of new foods and drinks, but especially beer, wine, and coffee. I even brew my own beer at home! Interestingly enough, brewing beer is what drew me to web development. It has always been fascinating to me how brewers can create so many different types and flavors of beer using the same four ingredients. Similarly, I’m intrigued by the amazingly varied programs and websites that can be created by combining a few lines of code in different ways. The possibilities are infinite and I can’t wait to explore them!</p>
          <p>If you would like to help me continue my journey as a developer, or even if you just want to chat about beer, please reach out! I have many skills to offer potential clients, including Java programming and fullstack web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My <a href="#contact">contact info</a> is below. Thanks for reading!</p>

          <h3>Moving Day</h3>
          <p>I created this full-stack app to help users keep organized during an upcoming move. Users can record inventory for every box they pack, as well as various notes such as the room it's coming from, the room it's going to, and how it's getting there. Users can also keep track of to-do lists for the whole family as well as moving-related contacts. This app was created using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS on the front end and Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the back end.

          <h3>Golden Outing</h3>
          <p>This front-end app assists photographers in making plans to utilize Golden Hour and Blue Hour in their photos. It provides Golden and Blue Hour times for the next 7 days for any location as well as hourly weather forecasts for those times. In addition, users can view the 10 nearest restaurants and hotels to the searched location to aid in trip planning. This app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
